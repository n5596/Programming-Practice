1. ord(): converts char to int
2. chr(): converts int to char
3. If A xor B = C, B xor C = A and A xor C = B
4. A xor 0 = A (0 is identity for XOR)
5. Strings are immutable in Python. Cannot use operations like s[i] = c (assignment).
6. To find unique numbers in a list, convert it to a set and then back to a list. A = list(set(A)).
7. To find the jth column of a grid in python, use list comprehension: col = [sub[j] for sub in grid]. To find the jth row, simply use grid[j].
8. Use range(l,m,n) where range starts at l, ends at m-1 and increments by n.
9. To sort dict by values: sort = sorted(di.values()). If we want to sort in desc order: sort = sorted(di.values(), reverse=True).
10. To add the character 'c' 5 times ('ccccc') to a string s: s = s+'c'*5.
11. To find a%b where either one is negative: use fmod(a,b). Need to import fmod from math package.
12. To change the kth letter of a string (strings are immutable), convert to a list, change the list and then convert to a string: wlist = list(word), wlist[k] = c, word = "".join(wlist).
